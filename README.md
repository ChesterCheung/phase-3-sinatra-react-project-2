# Phase 3 Project Stock Transaction Tracker

I wanted to build an app in order to track my stock transactions. I was looking for a more convienent way to track my stock transactions along with the price and date. There is the ability to add multiple investors so you can track more than just one persons stock transactions. I added the ability to click on an investors name and pull all of their transactions.
